      Hi!
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking for a writing app without any complications?
      So am I. Nothing feels comfy or peaceful enough so I'm making my own thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's called Day Book but that might change.
      It's very basic: you can write pieces, save them and edit them.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually I'll add some other features I could really use for my work:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>Printing to PDF</li>
       <li>Versioning</li>
       <li>Sharing + Publishing</li>
       <li>Receiving feedback and revisions</li>
    </ul>
    Best,<br>

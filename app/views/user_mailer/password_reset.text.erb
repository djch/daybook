Hi <%= @user.name %>,

You requested to reset the password on your Day Book account.

To proceed, just open this link:
<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

If you didn't request this email, it's likely that someone entered your address by mistake
while trying to reset their own password. If that's the case, you don't need to take any
action and can safely disregard this email.
